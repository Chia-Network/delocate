* 0.3.0 (Monday 5 2014)

  Second public release

  * Switch to using just ``@loader_path`` rather than a combination of
    ``@loader_path`` and ``@rpath`` for pointing to relocated libraries.  Using
    ``@rpath`` was giving some errors of form::

        "install_name_tool: changing install names or rpaths can't be redone
        for: libsomething.dylib (for architecture x86_64) because larger updated
        load commands do not fit (the program must be relinked, and you may need
        to use -headerpad or -headerpad_max_install_names)

    |--| presumably because ``@rpath`` had been zero length before we got to the
    library.
  * Add flag to display depending libraries as well as the libraries a tree /
    wheel depends on.
  * Use canonical paths for depended and depending library paths, including
    following symbolic links.  This means that two links pointing to the same
    file don't appear to be two different libraries, causing an error when
    copying the second into the directory containing the copied libraries.
  * Don't raise an error when delocating a wheel that was previously delocated
    (MinRK)

* 0.2.1 (Monday March 31 2014)

  Bugfix release

  * Rewrite wheel RECORD file when writing wheel.  Delocated wheels were
    breaking ``wheel unpack`` command.

* 0.2.0 (Tuesday March 25 2014)

  First public release
